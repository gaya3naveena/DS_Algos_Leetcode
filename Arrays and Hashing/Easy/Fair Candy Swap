Q) 
Alice and Bob have candy bars of different sizes: A[i] is the size of the i-th bar of candy that Alice has, and B[j] is the size of the j-th bar of candy that Bob has.

Since they are friends, they would like to exchange one candy bar each so that after the exchange, they both have the same total amount of candy.  (The total amount of candy a person has is the sum of the sizes of candy bars they have.)

Return an integer array ans where ans[0] is the size of the candy bar that Alice must exchange, and ans[1] is the size of the candy bar that Bob must exchange.

If there are multiple answers, you may return any one of them.  It is guaranteed an answer exists.

Input: A = [1,2], B = [2,3]
Output: [1,2]


Constraints:
1 <= A.length <= 10000
1 <= B.length <= 10000
1 <= A[i] <= 100000
1 <= B[i] <= 100000

Time Complexity:
O(n^2  Brute force implementation of the logic



Logic:

Assume a>b 
a-b = x (difference) 

a has x (x/2 + x/2) more than b 
swap x/2 from b and x to a => a-(x)+(x/2) = b-(x/2)+(x)

a = b+x 
so find a candy pair whose diff is exactly x/2 




Solution :

class Solution {
    public int[] fairCandySwap(int[] A, int[] B)
    {
         int sumA = 0;
         int sumB = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < A.length; i++)
            sumA += A[i];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < B.length; i++)
            sumB += B[i];
        
        int dif = (sumA - sumB) / 2;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < A.length; i++)
        {
            for (int j = 0; j < B.length; j++)
            {
                if (A[i] - B[j] == dif)
                    return new int[]{A[i], B[j]};
            }
        }
        return null;
        
    }
}

Takeaway : 
In sums like these don't think in terms of individual entities and how to manipulate them.
Combine both and see how you can arrive at a simpler solution.
